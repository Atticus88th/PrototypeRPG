# PrototypeRPG

A template for RPG games that I hope to extend.

---

## Dependencies

1. MonoGame for Xamarin Studio (for Mac project)
2. MonoGame for Visual Studio (for Windows project)

---

## Contributing

1. Fork this repo
2. Hack away
3. Submit a pull request

I usually spend my idle hours at `#openra` on `irc.freenode.net`, feel free to contact me.

---

## Help Needed

Unfortunately with MonoGame you have to create and build from a specific project for each platform.

I would greatly appreciate any help to make this available for Linux.

#### Next TODOs:

1. Seamless sprite animation
2. Basic collision
