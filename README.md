# PrototypeRPG

A template for RPG games that I hope to extend.

## Dependencies

1. Monogame for Mac (including MonoMac)
2. Patience

## Contributing

1. Fork this repo
2. Hack away
3. Submit a pull request

## Help Needed

Unfortunately with Monogame you have to create and build from a specific project for each platform.

I would greatly appreciate any help to make this available for Windows and Linux.
